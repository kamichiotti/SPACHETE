createFarJunctions_SLURM.sh:#Prior to alignment with the reference indices a python script SplitFastaforBadFJ.py called by the shell LenientBadFJ_SLURM is used to 1) remove all N's from the fasta sequences and 2) split the fasta sequence into a "read1" and "read2" file -- <FJdir>/BadFJ_ver2/<Stem>/<Stem>_FarJunctions_R1/2.fa.  The read 1s are the first 40 non-N bases and the read 2's are the last 40 non-N reads from the sequence.
