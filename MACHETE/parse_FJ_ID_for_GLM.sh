##Make fJ Class input files for GLM
##parse_FJ_ID_for_GLM.sh is a simple shell script that takes the ID files generated above in FJDir/reports/IDs_<STEM>.txt as inputs and removes any unmapped or unaligned read IDs using the "grep -v" command.  The outputs are fed into FJDir/GLM_classInput/<STEM>__output_FJ.txt with the other class input files for the GLM.
